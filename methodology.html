<!-- RESEARCH OBJECTIVE -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Research Objective</h2>
    <p>The major objective of this study is to analyze the impact of sargassum seaweed accumulation on tourism in Belize by integrating environmental data and stakeholder perspectives to inform sustainable management and mitigation strategies.</p>
</section>

<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Sargassum seaweed accumulation on Belize’s coastlines is negatively impacting tourism by degrading seaside areas and causing medical problems to locals, which affects tourists’ experiences and local businesses’ revenues. Despite its growing presence and the strong odor it emits around the shorelines and beaches, there is limited data that combines environmental measurements with stakeholder perspectives to comprehensively understand its effects on tourism. This lack of integrated information hinders effective planning, response strategies, and sustainable tourism development (FAO, n.d.; Milledge & Harvey, 2016).</p>
</section>

<!-- BACKGROUND -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Since 2014, sargassum influxes have increased significantly across the Caribbean, evolving into a recurring seasonal crisis (Wang et al., 2019). Belize has been particularly affected due to its reliance on coastal and marine tourism. Climate change, rising sea surface temperatures, and nutrient enrichment from river runoff have contributed to the rapid appearance and transboundary movement of sargassum mats toward Caribbean coastlines (Johns et al., 2020).</p>
    <p>In 2025, Belize experienced record-breaking levels of sargassum, resulting in severe environmental and economic consequences. Popular tourist destinations such as San Pedro saw shorelines overwhelmed by thick sargassum mats, leading to beach closures, canceled tours, and reduced visitor satisfaction, directly affecting tourism-dependent communities. Observations will include measuring seaside coverage of sargassum and rating beach odor and appearance, providing context to better understand how sargassum affects the quality of tourist destinations.</p>

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>This research uses a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys and direct observations to investigate the impact of sargassum on tourism in Belize. By blending quantitative and qualitative methods, the study captures both measurable environmental effects and the perceptions of key stakeholders.</p>
    <p>The survey, included as Appendix A, consists of 25 closed-ended questions with rating scales and multiple-choice items. Surveys were chosen as the primary data collection tool because they allow collection of detailed information from tourists, local residents, and business owners, enabling a comprehensive view of sargassum’s effects.</p>
    <p>The survey will be administered in person to tourists and local residents at the main study area, while selected business owners will receive it via email through local tourism networks. Observations will include measuring seaside coverage of sargassum and rating beach odor and appearance. A mixed-method systematic sampling method using snowball sampling will be applied for in-person surveys, where every third person encountered will be invited to participate. The sample will consist of 10 local residents, 10 tourists, and 5 business owners, totaling 25 participants. Each participant is expected to complete the survey in approximately 30 minutes. Participation is voluntary, and informed consent will be obtained. No identifying information will be collected.</p>
    <p>A limitation of this methodology is that some participants may decline to take part or fail to complete the survey, particularly business owners who receive it via email, which may result in a smaller dataset than anticipated.</p>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Sargassum accumulation significantly degrades Belize’s beaches, negatively affecting tourism revenues, visitor experiences, and stakeholder livelihoods of fisheries and local residents. The lack of integrated environmental and perceptual data limits comprehensive understanding and effective management of the issue.</p>

<!-- RECOMMENDATIONS -->
<section class="research-section">
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Implement a Digital Monitoring System:</strong> Establish a national sargassum monitoring platform using satellite data and AI forecasting for early warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Invest in Preventive Management:</strong> Shift from reactive cleanup strategies to proactive offshore interception and sustainable removal methods.</li>
    </ul>
